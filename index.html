    <h1>Earth - The Prologue</h1>
    <p> Long ago, all was right in the universe. The eight planets in our solar system revolved
peacefully around the Sun . Everything was normal. Until one day, the Sun disappeared from the solar system without a trace. With the Sunâ€™s sudden disappearance , all the planets have been battling each other to become the new "Sun". All but one. It's up to the Earth to resolve this conflict and bring peace to the solar system.
