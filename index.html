    <h2>Earth - The Prologue</h2>
    <p> Long ago, all was right in the universe. The eight planets in our solar system revolved
peacefully around the Sun . Everything was normal. Until one day, the Sun disappeared from the solar system without a trace. With the Sun’s sudden disappearance , all the planets have been battling each other to become the new "Sun". All but one. It's up to the Earth to resolve this conflict and bring peace to the solar system.

       Earth vs Mercury
       Earth:Mercury, what's going on?
       Mercury: With the Sun gone, the planets        have gone crazy. They're fighting among        themselves to decide which of them will        become the "new Sun".
       Earth: Is there any way I can help?
       Mercury: Yes you can give me your canon.        If that power falls into the wrong hands        who knows what may happen.
       Earth: I'm sorry I can't. I need this          canon to defend myself from the others.
       Mercury: In that case, you leave me no          choice.

      V: Earth I don't want to fight you
      E: Oh good, I was so worried that-
      V: But it seems I have no choice.
      E:HUH?!?!
      V: If I don't stop you'll move on to           attack the others and declare yourself         the new Sun, right?
      E: NO! That's not it at all!
      V: If you don't want to fight then you         won't mind giving me that canon, right?

      E: Jupiter please. ..
      J: What's up? I mean, besides the sky.         (heh)
      E: I don’t know what’s The Sun is gone         and now everyone is fighting each other.
      J: Hmmm. This seems all too convenient to       just be a coincidence.
      E: What are you saying
      J: I'm saying someone must have planet.  
      E: Do you know who could be behind it?
      J: Saturn might know. You should give           them a ring. (heh)
      E: Thanks glad we resolved this         peacefully. 
      J:Just one question.
      E:Huh?
      J:What do I use to keep my trousers up?
      E: What?
